## Project Description   
A Starbucks landing page, crafted with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, offers a visually captivating experience. Users can explore the menu, view nutritional info, and locate nearby stores. The responsive design ensures a seamless experience on all devices, embodying the essence of Starbucks' quality and creativity.
## Responsiveness Issue and its Solutions

## Problem:

The Starbucks website's non-responsive layout poses various issues. It displays poorly on different screen sizes, with problems such as an unresponsive phone layout, a non-adaptive navbar, font inconsistencies, and misaligned coffee cup images. These issues need to be addressed for a smoother user experience.

## Solution:
To fix the responsiveness issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use CSS Flexbox/Grid**: 
To enhance the layout of the Starbucks website, consider reorganizing it using CSS Flexbox and Grid. This will ensure that elements automatically adjust based on the screen size, providing a more flexible and responsive design.

2. **Responsive Images**:
 Ensure that any images used on the Starbucks website are also responsive. Use the max-width property to prevent them from overflowing on small screens.

4. **Font Size and Spacing**: 
To ensure the Starbucks website elements fit nicely on small screens without overlapping, adjust font sizes and spacing between elements accordingly.

5. **Test on Multiple Devices**:
After implementing the changes, it's essential to conduct thorough testing of the Starbucks website on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it maintains a visually pleasing appearance across all platforms.
