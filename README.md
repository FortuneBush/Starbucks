The Starbucks website's layout is not responsive, causing it to display improperly on various screen sizes.

## Solution:
To fix the responsiveness issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use CSS Flexbox/Grid**: 
To enhance the layout of the Starbucks website, consider reorganizing it using CSS Flexbox and Grid. This will ensure that elements automatically adjust based on the screen size, providing a more flexible and responsive design.

2. **Responsive Images**:
 Ensure that any images used on the Starbucks website are also responsive. Use the max-width property to prevent them from overflowing on small screens.

4. **Font Size and Spacing**: 
To ensure the Starbucks website elements fit nicely on small screens without overlapping, adjust font sizes and spacing between elements accordingly.

5. **Test on Multiple Devices**:
After implementing the changes, it's essential to conduct thorough testing of the Starbucks website on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it maintains a visually pleasing appearance across all platforms.
