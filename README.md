## Issues and Solutions

### Responsiveness Issue

#### Problem:
The game's layout is not responsive, causing it to display improperly on various screen sizes.

#### Solution:
To fix the responsiveness issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use CSS Flexbox/Grid**: Reorganize the layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure elements adjust according to the screen size.

2. **Media Queries**: Implement media queries in your CSS to specify different styles for different screen sizes (e.g., small screens, tablets, and desktops).

3. **Font Size and Spacing**: Adjust font sizes and spacing between elements to make the game elements fit well on small screens without overlapping.

4. **Responsive Images**: Ensure any images used are also responsive. Use the `max-width` property to prevent them from overflowing on small screens.

5. **Test on Multiple Devices**: After making changes, thoroughly test the game on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks good everywhere.
